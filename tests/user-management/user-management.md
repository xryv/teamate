# User Management Module

This module is responsible for managing user-related functionality, including user creation and validation.

## Checked Tests

| Test Name          | Description                           | Status   |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|----------|
| User Creation Test | Verify that user instances are created correctly with the provided email and password. | âœ… Passed |

## Future Possible Tests

1. **Password Validation Test**: Ensure that passwords meet certain complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, special characters).
2. **Email Validation Test**: Validate email addresses to ensure they are properly formatted.
3. **Password Encryption Test**: Test the encryption mechanism used to store passwords in the database for security.
4. **User Authentication Test**: Verify that user credentials (email and password) are authenticated correctly during login.
5. **User Deletion Test**: Test the functionality to delete user accounts from the system.
